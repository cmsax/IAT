A project for an IAT of a WIP paper.

## Introduction

[Implicit Association Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit-association_test):

> The implicit-association test (IAT) is a measure within social psychology designed to detect the strength of a person's subconscious association between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory. It is commonly applied to assess implicit stereotypes held by test subjects, such as unconsciously associating stereotypically black names with words consistent with black stereotypes. The test's format is highly versatile, and has been used to investigate biases in racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, as well as assessing self-esteem.

This IAT is inspired by [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/).
